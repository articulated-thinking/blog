# Drawing Balanced Teams

There are some pretty good working lists of fallacies on the internet. None of them lists "argument from geometry" as a recognized fallacy, though Google informs me its a term associated with Kant's assertions that our intuitive understanding of geometric principles supports the notion of transcendent idealism, which doesn't bode well.

We'll try and steer clear of transcendent idealism, here, but that effort may be in vain; "transcendent idealism" is a fair phrase to describe a lot of enthusiasm for software development paradigms, and that's what's on the agenda.

Janice Fraser did a talk about balanced teams as a Pivotal Labs tech talk a few months ago; the slides can be found [here][janice-slides]. A few of the slides in that deck use visual arrangements of roles to talk about models of collaboration and communication, and when I needed to articulate some of these ideas when I spoke at [CAST] earlier this year, I went looking for those visuals by googling things like "balanced team diagram." I didn't get what I wanted and for some reason didn't think to dig up Janice's slideshare account, so I re-created what I thought I needed and made this:

![A captioned triangle. The points: product management, product design, product engineering. The caption: Everybody Tests.][everybody-tests]

And it was good, because it gave me something to gesture at meaningfully during my talk about the role of testing competency in Pivotal's product teams.

Something interesting about this diagram - and the diagrams Janice used to inspire me - is that the components of the diagram's positioning and structure is only meaningful in relation to other components. They have no relation to their outside context; you could rotate the diagram or transpose it to another field, and its meaning would be unaffected. But if I compare the diagram I made to the ones Janice actually used, they have different emphasis; the shapes we chose to actual draw and those we choose simply to imply are different, even though structurally they're very similar.

So, if we want to make a sophist diagram arguing from geometry, we might consider explicitly trading on the meaning of the size, shape and specific location of diagram components, in addition to their relative position.

When I was designing my "everybody tests" slide, I drew things like this:

![A picture of a notebook. It has sketches of triangles with circles in various overlapping patterns drawn from the points and center of the triangle, and multi-colored annotations.][geometry-scratch-1] 

The emphasis here ends up being on the circles, which are the most varied and colorful element, and I think that's a reasonable focus for the thing to have. The final design of the slide ended up emphasizing the nodes (also rendered as circles) and, more than anything else, the connecting relationships between nodes. The circles were absent, except to the extent that the nodes themselves were depicted as circles.



## Points of Articulation
- I didn't actually see much Janice's talk; I had a scheduling conflict, and only happened to hang out by the event space while some of the relevant points were discussed. This is one of the many benefits of a working environment that is, as my colleague Natalie Bennett pointed out, basically an ongoing, low-intensity software conference.
- When I say this is a sophist diagram, I am not just forgetting to type "icated."
