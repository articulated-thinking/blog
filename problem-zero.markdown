# Problem Zero
If you are alive, you have problems. If you are trying to improve the world on some way, if you are trying to accomplish some goal, you have even more.

But your problems are locked away from you. The problem that stand between you and them is the unavoidably highest-priority problem a thinking being ever has. This problem is **what should I do right now?** I call this question Problem Zero, and the skills and practices I've developed around addressing it effectively are the main reason I am not slowly dying under a pile of impossible dreams I never work toward achieving.

### I.
Problem Zero is in kind of a privileged place. Any time it is not solved, it has to be re-solved before you can make any progress toward any of your goals.


### II.
There's a _New Yorker_ cartoon which I nearly called famous just now because of how large it has loomed in my life. There's a woman sitting at a desk, looking harried, stacks and drifts of paper all around her. The caption is _I'm just making a list of everything I have to do, so I can freak out in some kind of order."_ One of my closest friends had it up on her refrigerator for a decade.

Lists can be very helpful. They are often better than nothing. They have important flaws, as ongoing tools to address Problem Zero.

### III.
Of course, your queue of problems is fractal. Problem Zero occurs at every level. Hammering a nail is a queue of problems that is headed up by Problem Zero, each of which starts with Problem Zero, however fine you choose to slice it. You probably don't want an infinitely fractal stack of explicit backlog management tools to address it at each and every level, but you may find you can use two or three, up around the levels humans usually have to grapple with. As we progress down the stack, it becomes easier to conceptually decompose tasks into procedures that are repeatably much the same - the fixed list comes back to full strength as a procedural checklist, at this level.

## Points of Articulation
- I couldn't find the cartoon in question online when I sat down to write this. The best I could do appeared to be a rehash of the idea around a family apparently planning a vacation. (I hate it.) As you might expect, I spent probably _half_ of the time I put into writing this post about task management trying to find an old (and, really, not even that special) cartoon.
- I started zero-indexing lists as I got into programming, but I think my use of zero here is more informed by Asimov's "zeroth law of robotics."
- There's something deeply antisocial about writing about one's time management techniques. I apologize for the self-indulgence.
